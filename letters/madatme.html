    <h1 contenteditable="false">Open when we have an argument.</h1>
    <div class="editable" contenteditable="false">
In 8 months that we were together, there wasnâ€™t any argument we had that we didnâ€™t bounce back from. Weâ€™ve been through so much together, that now our bond is stronger than anything else in this world. In situations like these, I want you to remember that I love you so much, and that no argument we could have, no matter how bad, could ever stop me from loving you. If youâ€™re mad at me because of something I said or did, I want you to know that i apologize for anything I could have done, or said. If I did anything stupid, Iâ€™m still learning how to be good for you, how to treat you well. If I make a mistake or two, I deeply apologize for it, and please, be patient with my dumb idiot ass. Iâ€™m still learning how to love you properly. 
But if I am mad at you, then Iâ€™m probably just stressed, anxious, or overthinking/jealous. Just give me some time and space and then Iâ€™ll come back, and Iâ€™ll tell you exactly how Iâ€™m feeling. I have this weird bad habit of completely shutting down my feelings when Iâ€™m not feeling good or when Iâ€™m hurt. I canâ€™t really control it, but youâ€™re the only person who knows how to handle me when Iâ€™m being like this. Just be patient with me, and I can guarantee you that Iâ€™ll come back even stronger and better for you. I love you, Doha. If we had an argument and I said anything hurtful, know that I did not mean it, baby. Youâ€™ll always be the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me!
