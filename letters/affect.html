Look, I get it. You look at yourself in the mirror, and think to yourself â€˜how can anyone even like how I lookâ€™. I donâ€™t blame you for thinking that way, because we all do. In fact, it could be a problem If you DONâ€™T think that way every once in a while. But you just gotta know that itâ€™s not your fault that you think that way. The conditions in which you live, that toxic family you live withâ€¦ Thatâ€™s the true problem. Theyâ€™re the problem, they make you think that way. In days like these, I just want you to remember how beautiful you look in my eyes, and in your friendsâ€™ eyes. Your family is jealous of you â€“ thatâ€™s why they do what they do. These types of feelings are very common, you just gotta know how to deal with them. It even happens to me a lot, yk. Sometimes Iâ€™d feel like posting a story or sending you a pic of me then Iâ€™d be like â€˜nah, I look like shitâ€™ then I donâ€™t do it. You have NO IDEA how many times this happened to me. But just remember, you ARE beautiful. Your face is BEAUTIFUL, your eyes, your smile, your nose, your hair (I didnâ€™t see it yet but ik it is), your body is a fucking masterpiece, your arms, your legs, your back, your chestâ€¦ everything about you is beautiful, and I mean it with every beat of my heart. So just please, PLEASE, whenever you feel like this, just read this and BELIEVE in ME and YOURSELF, when I tell you that youâ€™re so fucking gorgeous. Give yourself MORE VALUE. And for the record, you, as a person, as so much fucking more than your body!    </div>
